CPSC 2430 Project 3: Binary Search Tree
// Purpose: Create a binary search tree and impliment differnt BST operations.
// Input: Can take user input for insertion, search, and removal. This program
// only takes user input for searching the tree.
// Process: Insert 20 random values into the BST, print these values in a
// pre order traversal and an in order traversal. Ask the user for a value and
// search the tree for value, returing if it was found or not. Print the min,
// max, and height of the tree. Delete four values for each deletion case: the
// root, a leaf, a single child node, and a two child node. These values are
// predetermined based on how the values are inserted into the tree. Print
// another in order traversal to show values were deleted. Create new trees to
// test copy constructor and overload operator.
// Output: A pre order and in order list of the original tree. The min, max, and
// height of tree. Another in order list of the tree after removal. The other
// three trees used to test copy and overload.
